# Auto-Save Fix Test Plan - UPDATED

## Problem Fixed:
When quitting a workout, it wasn't showing as "Ongoing workout" in Today's Workout section due to lack of auto-save functionality. Additionally, autosave was not properly associating workouts with user accounts.

## Solution Implemented:
1. **Added debounced auto-save functionality** - Changes to exercises are automatically saved after 500ms delay
2. **Removed manual save from addExercise** - Now relies on auto-save for consistency
3. **Improved quit workflow** - Clears pending auto-save before final save to prevent conflicts
4. **Added proper cleanup** - Prevents memory leaks by clearing timeouts on unmount
5. **Fixed user account association** - All autosave operations now properly associate with authenticated users
6. **Consistent storage layer usage** - All saves now go through WorkoutStorageSupabase for proper user context

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. Enhanced Auto-Save System with User Context
```typescript
// Added auto-save timeout ref
const autoSaveTimeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null)

// Enhanced save function with user validation
const saveWorkoutState = async (updatedExercises: Exercise[] = exercises) => {
  // Only save if we have user context
  if (!user || !supabase) {
    console.log('No user or supabase client, skipping save')
    return
  }

  // Use WorkoutStorageSupabase layer for consistent user association
  const workoutToSave = {
    id: workoutId,
    type: 'strength' as const,
    exercises: updatedExercises,
    startTime: new Date().toISOString(),
    elapsedTime: time,
    isRunning: isRunning,
    userId: user.id // Ensure user ID is properly set
  }

  await WorkoutStorageSupabase.saveOngoingWorkout(workoutToSave)
}
```

### 2. Improved User Context Validation
```typescript
// Initialize storage and load ongoing workout on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  const initializeAndLoad = async () => {
    // Only proceed if we have user context
    if (!user || !supabase) {
      console.log('No user or supabase client available, skipping initialization')
      return
    }

    // Initialize storage with user context
    WorkoutStorageSupabase.initialize(user, supabase)
    // ... rest of initialization
  }
}, [workoutId, user, supabase])
```

### 3. Enhanced WorkoutStorageSupabase Layer
```typescript
static async saveOngoingWorkout(workout: OngoingWorkout): Promise<void> {
  // Ensure we have user context
  if (!this.currentUser) {
    console.error('Cannot save workout: no user context available')
    return
  }

  // Ensure workout has proper user ID
  const workoutWithUser = {
    ...workout,
    userId: this.currentUser.id
  }

  // Use proper upsert with conflict resolution
  const { error } = await this.supabase
    .from('ongoing_workouts')
    .upsert({
      id: workout.id,
      user_id: this.currentUser.id, // Properly associate with user
      type: workout.type,
      // ... other fields
    }, {
      onConflict: 'user_id,type'  // Match database constraint
    })
}
```

## Testing Scenarios:

### Test 1: Basic Auto-Save with User Authentication
1. **Prerequisites:** User must be logged in
2. Start a new strength workout
3. Add an exercise (should auto-save after 500ms with user ID)
4. Add sets and modify reps/weights (should auto-save with user context)
5. Quit workout (X button)
6. Navigate back to workout page
7. **Expected:** Workout should appear in "Today's Workout" section with all changes preserved and properly associated with the user

### Test 2: Multi-User Isolation
1. **Prerequisites:** Two different user accounts
2. User A starts a workout and adds exercises
3. User B logs in and starts their own workout
4. User A quits and returns
5. **Expected:** User A sees only their workout, User B sees only their workout

### Test 3: Timer State Persistence with User Context
1. **Prerequisites:** User must be logged in
2. Start workout and let timer run for 2-3 minutes
3. Add exercises while timer is running
4. Quit workout while timer is still running
5. Return to workout page
6. **Expected:** Workout shows as "In Progress" with correct elapsed time and proper user association

### Test 4: Paused State Persistence with User Context
1. **Prerequisites:** User must be logged in
2. Start workout and pause timer
3. Add exercises while paused
4. Quit workout
5. Return to workout page
6. **Expected:** Workout shows as "Paused" with correct elapsed time and proper user association

### Test 5: Unauthenticated User Handling
1. **Prerequisites:** User is not logged in
2. Try to start a workout
3. **Expected:** Workout should not save to database, only to localStorage as fallback
4. User logs in
5. **Expected:** Previous localStorage data should be migrated to user's account

### Test 6: Database Constraint Validation
1. **Prerequisites:** User must be logged in
2. Start a strength workout
3. Try to start another strength workout (should replace the first one)
4. **Expected:** Only one strength workout per user should exist in database

## Database Verification:
Run these queries to verify proper user association:

```sql
-- Check ongoing workouts with user association
SELECT id, user_id, type, exercises, start_time, elapsed_time, is_running 
FROM ongoing_workouts 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Verify only one workout per user per type
SELECT user_id, type, COUNT(*) as workout_count
FROM ongoing_workouts 
GROUP BY user_id, type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Result:
The enhanced auto-save system ensures that:
1. All workout changes are persisted automatically with proper user association
2. Workouts are properly isolated between different users
3. Database constraints are respected (one workout per user per type)
4. Fallback mechanisms work for unauthenticated users
5. The system gracefully handles user context changes
