# Auto-Save Fix Test Plan

## Problem Fixed:
When quitting a workout, it wasn't showing as "Ongoing workout" in Today's Workout section due to lack of auto-save functionality.

## Solution Implemented:
1. **Added debounced auto-save functionality** - Changes to exercises are automatically saved after 500ms delay
2. **Removed manual save from addExercise** - Now relies on auto-save for consistency
3. **Improved quit workflow** - Clears pending auto-save before final save to prevent conflicts
4. **Added proper cleanup** - Prevents memory leaks by clearing timeouts on unmount

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. New Auto-Save System
```typescript
// Added auto-save timeout ref
const autoSaveTimeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null)

// Debounced auto-save function
const debouncedAutoSave = async (updatedExercises: Exercise[]) => {
  // Clears previous timeout and sets new 500ms delay
  // Saves current workout state including exercises, time, and running status
}

// Auto-save trigger on exercises change
useEffect(() => {
  if (exercises.length > 0) {
    debouncedAutoSave(exercises)
  }
}, [exercises, time, isRunning, workoutId])
```

### 2. Improved Quit Workflow
```typescript
const quitWorkout = async () => {
  // Clear pending auto-save to avoid conflicts
  if (autoSaveTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(autoSaveTimeoutRef.current)
  }
  // Immediate final save before navigation
  // Navigate to workout page
}
```

## Testing Scenarios:

### Test 1: Basic Auto-Save
1. Start a new strength workout
2. Add an exercise (should auto-save after 500ms)
3. Add sets and modify reps/weights (should auto-save)
4. Quit workout (X button)
5. Navigate back to workout page
6. **Expected:** Workout should appear in "Today's Workout" section with all changes preserved

### Test 2: Timer State Persistence
1. Start workout and let timer run for 2-3 minutes
2. Add exercises while timer is running
3. Quit workout while timer is still running
4. Return to workout page
5. **Expected:** Workout shows as "In Progress" with correct elapsed time

### Test 3: Paused State Persistence
1. Start workout and pause timer
2. Add exercises while paused
3. Quit workout
4. Return to workout page
5. **Expected:** Workout shows as "Paused" with correct elapsed time

## Result:
The auto-save system ensures that all workout changes are persisted automatically, fixing the issue where workouts would disappear from the "Today's Workout" section after quitting and returning.
