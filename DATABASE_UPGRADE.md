# Database Upgrade Guide

## Issue Fixed
The infinite loading issue on dashboard and profile pages was caused by missing database triggers that automatically create user profiles when users sign up via OAuth.

## What to Do

### 1. Run the Updated Database Setup
Copy and paste the contents of `DATABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.sql` into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

**Important:** This will add a new trigger function that automatically creates profiles for new users.

### 2. Key Changes Made
- Added `handle_new_user()` function that creates profiles automatically
- Added trigger `on_auth_user_created` that fires when users sign up
- Improved error handling in the auth context
- Added fallback loading timeout (10 seconds)
- Better profile creation logic in the frontend

### 3. What This Fixes
- ✅ Infinite loading on dashboard/profile pages
- ✅ "Username not set" errors
- ✅ Profile creation failures for OAuth users
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging

### 4. After Running the SQL
1. Sign out and sign back in to test
2. Check the browser console for improved error messages
3. The profile should now load automatically

### 5. If Issues Persist
Check the browser console for detailed error messages. The improved logging will show exactly what's happening with profile creation.

## Verification
After running the SQL, you can verify the setup with these queries:

```sql
-- Check if the trigger function exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name = 'handle_new_user';

-- Check if the trigger is set up
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_table = 'users' AND trigger_schema = 'auth';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
```

## Notes
- The trigger function is set to `SECURITY DEFINER` to ensure it can create profiles even if the user doesn't have direct insert permissions
- If profile creation fails, it logs the error but doesn't fail the signup process
- The frontend now has a 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
