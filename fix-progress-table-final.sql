-- Complete Fix for Progress Images Table
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, drop the existing table if it has issues
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS progress_images CASCADE;

-- Recreate the table with proper UUID primary key (no sequence needed)
CREATE TABLE progress_images (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'progress' CHECK (image_type IN ('progress', 'before', 'after', 'current')),
    title TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    weight_kg DECIMAL(5,2), -- Optional weight at time of photo (e.g., 85.50)
    visibility VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'private' CHECK (visibility IN ('private', 'public')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_progress_images_user_id ON progress_images(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_progress_images_created_at ON progress_images(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_progress_images_image_type ON progress_images(image_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_progress_images_visibility ON progress_images(visibility);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE progress_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant permissions to authenticated users (UUID primary keys don't need sequence grants)
GRANT ALL ON progress_images TO authenticated;

-- Create RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own progress images" ON progress_images
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own progress images" ON progress_images
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own progress images" ON progress_images
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Optional: Public visibility policy
CREATE POLICY "Public can view public progress images" ON progress_images
    FOR SELECT USING (visibility = 'public');

-- Create or ensure storage bucket exists
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
