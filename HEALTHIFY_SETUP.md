# Healss Independent App Setup Instructions

## Overview
Healss has been implemented as a completely independent health & fitness app with shared authentication between kryloss.com and Healss.kryloss.com. The app follows the design.json specifications and features three main sections (Workouts, Nutrition, Progress) directly in the top navigation bar with "In Development" placeholders.

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/app/Healss/page.tsx` - Main Healss page
- `src/app/Healss/layout.tsx` - Healss layout with custom navigation
- `src/components/Healss-nav-bar.tsx` - Custom navigation bar for Healss
- `middleware.ts` - Updated with subdomain routing logic

## Subdomain Access

### Production (https://Healss.kryloss.com)
The subdomain is accessible directly at `https://Healss.kryloss.com`. No additional setup required.

### Localhost Testing (http://Healss.localhost:3000)
To test the subdomain locally, add the following entry to your hosts file:

#### Windows
1. Open `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` as Administrator
2. Add this line:
```
127.0.0.1    Healss.localhost
```

#### macOS/Linux
1. Open `/etc/hosts` as root/sudo
2. Add this line:
```
127.0.0.1    Healss.localhost
```

Then visit `http://Healss.localhost:3000` to access the Healss app directly.

**Important**: 
- The main site navigation will automatically detect the environment and link to the correct URLs
- Subdomain routing is handled by middleware for seamless experience
- Authentication is shared across all subdomains

## Authentication Sharing
The authentication is shared between kryloss.com and Healss.kryloss.com through:
- Shared Supabase client configuration
- Cookie-based authentication that works across subdomains
- Same AuthProvider context used in both applications

## Design Compliance
The page strictly follows the design.json specifications:
- Background: #0B0B0F
- Surface: #121318
- Borders: #212227, #2A2B31
- Text: #F3F4F6, #A1A1AA
- Accents: #2A8CEA, #1659BF, #103E9A
- Hero section includes radial gradient glow
- Cards use rounded-xl borders
- Buttons are pill-shaped
- "In Development" badges with animated pulse
