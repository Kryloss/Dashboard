## Test Scenarios

### Basic Template Saving
1. Create workout with multiple exercises
2. Add sets with different properties
3. Save as template with enhanced name
4. Verify all properties are preserved

### Property Validation
1. Test with missing properties (should get defaults)
2. Test with complete properties
3. Verify validation works correctly

### Database Integration
1. Check database directly for enhanced JSONB structure
2. Verify all properties are stored correctly

### Built-in Templates
1. Verify built-in templates use enhanced structure
2. Check all properties are present
3. Verify they load correctly

## Success Criteria
